Asp.Net Core app for the course C# MVC Frameworks-ASP.NET Core February 2022 @SoftUni. 
Hi Guys this is my first MVC ASP.NET Core app. It is writen on ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core, both on version 6.0. Im using SQL Ralation Database whit code first approach. For this project I am inspired by a really good baker Vqra Hristova and I hope one day to contribute to her development. 
In this app you can chose product and order baked products for next days. For admin area you can hire personal, calcolate profit for period of time and see order for five days ahead.
